The frontend of the flask web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Further refined personality prediction was done by integrating the Big 5 traits with a sophisticated Logistic Regression model. Streamlining data extraction from resumes, pyresparser was employed. Seamless integration of the Amazon Transcribe API to transcribe video inputs during interviews was done, subsequently subjecting them to Sentiment analysis using Google Cloud NLP AI Service. Enhancing facial emotion analysis, I utilized the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) model with MTCNN. Login credentials are stored in a MySQL database. Furthermore, an automated email system is implemented to promptly update candidates on their application status with a single click.
